# Code-Quiz
The object of this project was to build a timed quiz, which I chose to make a trivia game about my favorite team, the Seattle Mariners!
With each wrong answer the player is deducted 10 seconds from the clock. The time left when the questions are answered is the final score.
If the clock runs out before all questions are answered, the final score is 0.
Scores are currently being stored in local storage. The next step will be to allow the player to personalize and access the scores!
